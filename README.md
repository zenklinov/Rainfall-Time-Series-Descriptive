# Rainfall Time Series Descriptive

This repository contains notebooks and data related to descriptive analysis of rainfall time series data. The analysis includes graphical representations and statistical summaries to understand the patterns and variations in rainfall over time.

## Notebooks

### 1. 2D Graphic Rainfall Average per Month.ipynb
   This notebook utilizes data sourced from [NASA Power](https://github.com/zenklinov/nasapower) (`nasa_power_data_filtered_within.xlsx`) to create 2D graphical representations of average rainfall per month.

### 2. analisisdeksriptif(heatmap_rata-rata_total_per_bulan).ipynb
   Utilizes data from [rata-rata-varians-curah-hujan.xlsx](rata-rata-varians-curah-hujan.xlsx) to perform descriptive analysis, including generating heatmaps for total rainfall averages per month.
